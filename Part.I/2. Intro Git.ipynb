    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this class we will share lecture notes, assignments, problem sets, exams etc. in the same way software development teams would. In any such team it would be important not only to share pieces of code and other information but to attribute it, and to document when and where work has been added and changes have been made. In this way the team can review changes to a previous version, find bugs and easily use and relate to previous versions. Another advantage is that everybody can make changes to their own copy and later merge the changes back to a common code base. We will adopt the _distributed version control system_ [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).\n",

    "* clone the course repo: `git clone https://github.com/UVic-CompPhys/physmath248-2018.git` (because you do not need to write to the course repo you can use https here, but for your own repo ssh is strongly recommended as described above.)\n",

    "    - first it does `git fetch` which updates your local repo with all information from the remote,but it does not change any file on your active branch\n",
    "    - second it performs a `git merge` which does update files in your current branch\n",
    "    - for the course repo using `git pull` is entirely appropriate because you would not add anything yourself, and `merge` really means _just add the new things_\n",
    "* You would have maybe tried out some notebooks and done some tests to your cloned course repo. Then after the next class you do `git pull` to update your version of the course repo. But since you have modified some files since last time git would refuse to pull the new version as this would potentially overwrite some of your changes. There are two or three ways to deal with this:\n",
    "    1. instead of modifying the notebooks in place, create a `notes` dir in your own course repo, copy the notebook files for the current class there, and make your notes, try out things and customize. Then, commit these versions to your repo for savekeeping and future record.\n",
    "    2. Do what git tells you to do: `git stash` [_stashes away_](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) your changes, they are somewhere and could be recovered later if needed. Git now will pull the latest version from the remote.\n",
    "    3. `git checkout _changed file_` will replace the modified version of _changed file_ with the _unchanged file_ from last commit. This will allow git to pull the latest version.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once your own repo is in place the typical workflow involves:\n",
    "* `git add` to stage files you have newly created or modified for the next `commit` to the index\n",
    "* `git commit` creates a snapshot of the repo as it is staged in the index\n",
    "* `git push` will move the snapshot and the repo info to the remote repo on bitbucket.\n",
